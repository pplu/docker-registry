=head1 NAME

Docker::Registry - A client for talking to Docker Registries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Use AWSs Elastic Container Registry
  use Docker::Registry::ECR;
  my $reg = Docker::Registry::ECR->new(
    region => 'us-west-2',
    account_id => '0123456789',
  );
  my $repo_list = $reg->repositories;

  # Use Google Container Registry (GCR)
  use Docker::Registry::GCE;
  my $reg = Docker::Registry::GCE->new;
  my $repo_list $reg->repositories;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module helps you talk to different Docker Registries from different cloud
providers.

Docker Registry APIs are standard, but authentication methods differ from
vendor to vendor.  This set of modules helps manage that for you.

=head1 WARNING

Consider this code Alpha quality. It works, but only some read-only methods
have been implemented, and the API may still change. Be careful if you start
depending on this module.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 url

The URL of the registry. Most of the time this URL is automatically derived by
provider classes like (L<Docker::Registry::ECR>.

=head2 auth

An instance of an object that has the L<Docker::Registry::Auth> Role. See L</AUTHENTICATION> for
a list of authentication types. Subclasses (like L<Docker::Registry::GCE>) will set a default
authentication object appropriate for the specific provider. This is left injectable in the
constructor so the programmer can force a specific auth provider.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 repositories

Returns a L<Docker::Registry::Result::Repositories> object with the list of
repositories

=head2 repository_tags(name => $repo_name)

Returns a L<Docker::Registry::Result::RepositoryTags> object with the list of
tags

=head1 PROVIDERS

Different cloud providers of Docker registries have subtle differences between
them, so there are specialized classes for each supported provider:

L<Docker::Registry::Azure>

L<Docker::Registry::ECR>

L<Docker::Registry::GCE>

L<Docker::Registry::Gitlab>

=head1 AUTHENTICATION

Each registry class has it's authentication providers:

L<Docker::Registry::Auth::Basic>

L<Docker::Registry::Auth::ECR>

L<Docker::Registry::Auth::GCEServiceAccount>

L<Docker::Registry::Auth::Gitlab>

The most of the time the specialized provider tries to select the appropiate
authentication module, but it can be overrided with the C<auth> attribute
