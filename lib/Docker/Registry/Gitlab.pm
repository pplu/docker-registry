    use Docker::Registry::Gitlab;
    my $registry = Docker::Registry::Gitlab->new(

    );

Because Gitlab doesn't support wild cards in scopes (yet!), you are not
able to call certain functions. L<Docker::Registry::Gitlab/repositories>
being one of them. For more information see:
L<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/47497>
